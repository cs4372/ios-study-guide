## Control Flow

- if statement, for-in loops, repeat-while,switch statements, continue, break, etc

#### For-In Loops
```
//Iterate over an array

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
for fruit in fruits {
    print("Hello, \(fruit)!")
}
// Hello, Apple!
// Hello, Banana!
// Hello, Orange!

// Iterate over a dictionary

let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// cats have 4 legs
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
```

#### Repeat-While (do-while loop in other languages)

```
repeat {
    statements
} while condition
```

#### Switch statements
```
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"

// Value Bindings

let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
    print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
    print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
    print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"

//Where 

let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"

//Compound cases

let stillAnotherPoint = (9, 0)
switch stillAnotherPoint {
case (let distance, 0), (0, let distance):
    print("On an axis, \(distance) from the origin")
default:
    print("Not on an axis")
}
// Prints "On an axis, 9 from the origin"
```

#### Continue 
- tells a loop to stop what itâ€™s doing and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop

#### Break
- ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately
