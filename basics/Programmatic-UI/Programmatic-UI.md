## Auto Layout

Auto Layout constraints allow us to create views that dynamically adjust to different size classes and positions. 

#### Steps to remove storyboard in project: 
1. Remove Storyboard 
2. Click on the Project, in this case, AutoLayout. Go to info, under Custom iOS Target Properties, remove `Main storyboard file base name` and `Storyboard name` under Scene Configuration

#### Lay out a user interface

1. Frame (Less preferred)

e.g 
```
let button = UIButton()
self.view.addSubview(button)
button.frame = CGRect(x: 100, y: 100, width: 120, height: 44)
````

2. Programmatic Auto Layout


#### Writing constraints by using Layout Anchors

- set the `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` to false. This is to prevent the viewâ€™s auto-resizing mask to be translated into Auto Layout constraints and affecting your constraints.


#### Create  an array of constraints
```
NSLayoutConstraint([
    view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.centerXAnchor),
    view.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: superview.centerYAnchor),
    view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100),
    view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.widthAnchor)
])
```

This creates a square and centers it in its superview. The last line is needed to actually activate the constraints so they make your layout appear as expected.
